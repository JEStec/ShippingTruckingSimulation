Project for SE 350 -- Object Oriented Software Development

Stage 1: implement facilities, inventory of facilities, network of facilities and calculate distances between facilities
Stage 2: implement orders and determine total cost of order as well as how many sources/facilities are needed to fulfill the quantity of the ordered products

Stage 3 was supposed to determine start and end time per order, however, we ran out of time in class.
